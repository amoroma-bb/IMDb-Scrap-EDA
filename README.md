# Data Analysis

## 1. Data Cleaning and validation
- replace Certificate, Gross, Metascore ' ' with np.nan
- reset runtime to int
- reset the genre to split type column with 1 and 0

## 2. EDA
### The distribution of each certification of these movies dataset 
- R ranks the first, which is over 7000 movies
- PG-13 and PG ranks the second and third position 
    
- The distribution of rating 
    - most rating ranges from 6.1 to 8.1
    
- The distribution of movie time

- Year vs. Gross with hue of certificate

- Mean rating vs. Year
    - Mean rating decreases with the year increases

    - Mean movie time vs. Year

- Top_6 popular genre movie: Drama, Comedy, Action, Adventure, Crime, Thriller
    - Rating vs. Year
    - Movie time vs. Year
    - Gross vs. Year
    - Certificate counts 
    - dist plot
    
- Correlation 


# Machine Learning 
## Data Cleaning and validation
    1. replace certificate to num list
    2. fillna of Metascore and Gross with mean
    3. replace rating to 5 categories (> 9.5, 8.5 ~ 9.5, 7 ~ 8.5, 5 ~ 7, < 5)

## Normalization 
    - (x - miu)/range for each x in title, year, certificate, metascore, votes, gross, movie_time_min

## Simple machine learning model
    - LogisticRegression
    - Training Accurancy: 74.78 %
    - Testing Accurancy: 74.02 %
